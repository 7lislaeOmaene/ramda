One of the critics, Matt Fowler from IGN, gave the season a 7.8/10 and praised the introduction of God and Amara, but criticized the lack of focus and direction in some episodes. He wrote: \"Supernatural's eleventh season gave us a satisfying, universe-threatening big picture arc to work with - one that drew out all of the show's heavy-hitters (plus God!) - but then didn't stick the landing.\"[^1^]
 
The fans also expressed their love and appreciation for the show and its characters on various platforms, such as Twitter, Facebook, Reddit and Tumblr. Many fans enjoyed the emotional moments between Sam and Dean, the humor and references to pop culture, the return of old favorites like Bobby and Charlie, and the exploration of the mythology and lore of the show.
